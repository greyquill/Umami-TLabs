Dear Dr. Sushma,
Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. It was great discussing your lab’s current setup and requirements around increasing customer inflow through digital and platform-based initiatives.
To keep track of our discussion, below is a brief summary of the key points from our conversation and the agreed next steps:
Summary of Discussion
We discussed the need to increase customer inflow and better utilize the lab’s existing capacity through a phased digital approach.
The initial focus would be on building a strong digital foundation, starting with:
SEO and structured content around your lab’s services and health check-up packages.
A niche and locality-focused strategy rather than competing head-on with large national labs.
Explored how targeted digital marketing (Google, Meta, etc.) can work alongside SEO to create a consistent funnel of relevant customers.
Discussed the importance of a simple but effective digital platform (web-based initially) that can support:
Appointment booking
Sample collection scheduling
Test progress and result updates
Ongoing engagement through notifications (SMS/WhatsApp, etc.)
The long-term goal is to create a customer experience that is on par with or better than existing large lab platforms, while remaining scalable to your current size.
Information That Will Help Us Finalize the Plan
To tailor the plan accurately, it would be helpful to understand:
Types of tests and health packages currently offered
Approximate lab capacity and daily/weekly test volume
Sample collection process (in-house or third-party, home collection availability) - which will help us plan the platform better.
Current appointment or booking method (manual, third-party, or internal)
Next Steps
Our team will prepare a documented plan outlining:
Current state vs. target state
Phased approach (SEO, marketing, platform enablement)
Timelines and measurable outcomes (initially over a ~3-month horizon)
Cost impact - to be able to decide priority
We will share this document with you in the next 1–2 days for your review.
Once aligned on the plan, we can then discuss commercials and engagement structure, including flexible or outcome-based options if needed.
Please feel free to let us know if there’s anything specific you’d like us to factor into the plan.
Looking forward to sharing the detailed proposal and continuing the discussion.

Warm regards,
