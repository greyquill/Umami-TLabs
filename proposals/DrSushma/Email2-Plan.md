Dear Dr. Sushma,

As discussed, I'm sharing the detailed plan document that outlines our 90-day digital transformation strategy for your lab.

The document covers:
- Current state analysis and target outcomes
- A phased approach (SEO, marketing, and platform enablement) over 12 weeks
- Platform scope and features
- Metrics we'll track to measure success
- Information we'll need from your side to get started

**Key focus:** The plan is structured to help us agree on outcomes and priorities first. Once we're aligned on what success looks like and which phase to start with, we can discuss the engagement model and cost structure that works best for you.

**Next step:** Once you've had a chance to review the plan, I'd suggest we schedule a 30-minute working session to:
- Validate our assumptions about your current setup
- Confirm priorities and lock the Phase 1 scope
- Agree on specific success metrics for the 90-day period
- Decide on the engagement model that fits your needs

This will help us move forward with clarity and ensure we're building exactly what will drive results for your lab.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the plan, or if there's anything specific you'd like us to adjust before our working session.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Warm regards,
