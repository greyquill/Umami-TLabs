Phase 3: How to Drive the Conversation Forward (Tactically)
After Sending the Plan:

In your email or WhatsApp follow-up, include one clear CTA:

“Once you’ve had a chance to review, we’d suggest a 30-minute working session to align on assumptions, confirm priorities, and lock the Phase-1 scope.”

This:

Prevents passive “we’ll review”

Positions the next call as decision-oriented

Phase 4: The Second Call (Very Important)

Your second call objective is NOT selling.

Your objective should be:

Validate assumptions

Lock Phase 1 only

Agree on success metrics

Decide engagement model

If Phase 1 is successful → Phase 2 becomes obvious.

4. Strategic Insight (Why This Is Working Well)

You did three things right in the call:

Didn’t oversell “just an app”

Positioned digital as a growth engine, not marketing expense

Introduced outcome-based pricing without pressure

Your next step should preserve that tone:

“Let’s agree on the plan and outcomes first. Cost follows clarity.”

That’s exactly how senior decision-makers think.
