## Define the 3-Month Outcome (VERY Important)

Avoid vague outcomes like “more traffic.”

Instead define measurable business outcomes, for example:

X% increase in inbound inquiries

X bookings per week by Month 3

Cost per lead benchmark

Capacity utilization improvement

This makes outcome-based pricing credible, not vague.
